# keycode-generator
Brief is to create a keycode generator similar to keycode.info

My workflow involved creating the structure in HTML initially and
used Javascript DOM and keyboardEvent.code property to retrun a value when key is pressed.

My next attempt is to make it mobile friendly which will involve:
creating an input that will allow user to press the key.
